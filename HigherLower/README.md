INSTRUCTIONS:

This simple webpage prompts a user to enter a maximum number to create a range for guessing a random number.
Once the user enters the number, the guessing process begins. The user submits various guesses and hints of "higher" or "lower"
are provided until the user guesses correctly. The users guesses are stored in an array and the amount of guesses and guesses
themselves are shown at the end.
